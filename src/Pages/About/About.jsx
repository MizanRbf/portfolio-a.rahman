        I'm Md Abdur Raman, a dedicated Performance Marketing & Tracking
        Specialist with a sharp focus on driving measurable growth through
        strategic advertising and precise analytics. I specialize in Google Ads
        (Building and optimizing high-ROI campaigns across Search, Display,
        Shopping, and YouTube), Meta Ads (Crafting full-funnel strategies on
        Facebook and Instagram to engage, convert, and retain customers), and
        Web Analytics & Tracking (Implementing advanced tracking solutions using
        Google Tag Manager (GTM) and Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to ensure clean,
        actionable data powers every decision). My strength lies in blending
        creative ad strategy with technical expertiseâ€”ensuring every click,
        impression, and conversion is accounted for. I work with brands to not
        only reach the right audience but to fully understand and scale what
        works. If you're looking to elevate your marketing with
        performance-backed strategies and reliable analytics, you're in the
        right place.
