          I'm Md Abdur Raman, a dedicated Performance Marketing & Tracking
          Specialist with a sharp focus on driving measurable growth through
          strategic advertising and precise analytics. I specialize in Google
          Ads (Building and optimizing high-ROI campaigns across Search,
          Display, Shopping, and YouTube), Meta Ads (Crafting full-funnel
          strategies on Facebook and Instagram to engage, convert, and retain
          customers), and Web Analytics & Tracking (Implementing advanced
          tracking solutions using Google Tag Manager (GTM) and Google Analytics
          4 (GA4) to ensure clean, actionable data powers every decision). My
          strength lies in blending creative ad strategy with technical
          expertiseâ€”ensuring every click, impression, and conversion is
          accounted for. I work with brands to not only reach the right audience
          but to fully understand and scale what works. If you're looking to
          elevate your marketing with performance-backed strategies and reliable
          analytics, you're in the right place.
